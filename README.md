# AI-Enhanced Resource Allocation Graph Simulator

An interactive web-based simulator for resource allocation graphs with AI-powered analysis and optimization suggestions.

## Overview

This Resource Allocation Graph (RAG) Simulator is a modern web application built with Flask that allows users to visualize and analyze resource allocation in operating systems. It provides an intuitive interface for creating resources, defining processes, allocating resources to processes, and detecting potential deadlocks.

What sets this simulator apart from traditional RAG tools is its integration of AI technologies that analyze resource allocation patterns, provide optimization suggestions, and predict potential deadlocks before they occur.

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Resource Management**: Create and manage resources with specific unit counts
- **Process Management**: Add processes and allocate resources to them
- **Interactive Graph Visualization**: View the allocation graph with dynamic, interactive controls
- **Deadlock Detection**: Automatically detect cycles in the resource allocation graph that indicate potential deadlocks

### AI-Enhanced Features
- **Resource Usage Pattern Analysis**: Machine learning algorithms identify common resource allocation patterns
- **Optimization Suggestions**: AI-generated recommendations to improve resource allocation strategy
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecast future resource needs based on current usage patterns
- **Utilization Analysis**: Intelligent analysis of resource usage efficiency

### Modern User Interface
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic graphs with zoom, pan, and filtering capabilities
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate visual feedback when modifying the allocation state
- **Exportable Results**: Save graphs, analysis results, and optimization suggestions

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python with Flask web framework
- **Data Processing**: NetworkX for graph operations, scikit-learn for AI features
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript with Bootstrap 5
- **Visualization**: Vis.js for network graphs, Plotly for data visualization
- **AI Components**: K-means clustering for pattern detection, predictive analytics for resource forecasting

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/resource-allocation-graph.git
   cd resource-allocation-graph
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

## Usage Guide

### Getting Started
1. Add resources with specific unit counts (e.g., CPUs, memory, printers)
2. Create processes that need to use these resources
3. Allocate resources to processes
4. Make resource requests from processes
5. Visualize the resulting graph and analyze for deadlocks

### AI Analysis
1. After creating several resources and processes with various allocation patterns
2. Navigate to the AI Analysis page to see usage patterns
3. Check the Optimization page for AI-generated suggestions
4. Use the insights to improve your resource allocation strategy

## Educational Value

This simulator serves as an excellent educational tool for:
- **Students** learning about operating systems and deadlock concepts
- **Educators** demonstrating resource allocation mechanisms
- **Researchers** exploring various allocation strategies
- **Professionals** training on deadlock prevention techniques

## Patent-Worthy Innovations

This simulator introduces several novel approaches to resource allocation visualization and analysis:

1. **AI-Driven Deadlock Prediction**: Uses machine learning to identify patterns that may lead to deadlocks before they occur, a significant improvement over traditional cycle-detection approaches.

2. **Resource Utilization Fingerprinting**: Creates unique "fingerprints" of resource usage patterns for different types of processes, enabling more intelligent allocation strategies.

3. **Interactive Multi-Dimensional Visualization**: Novel approach to visualizing complex resource relationships in an intuitive, interactive manner.

4. **Predictive Resource Scaling**: AI algorithms that recommend optimal resource allocation based on historical and predicted usage patterns.
